Hi! My name is JungHo. I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the joint Statistics and Public Policy program at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Edward H. Kennedy](https://www.ehkennedy.com/). Before CMU, I obtained an M.S. in Statistics at the University of Chicago under the guidance of [Panos Toulis](https://www.ptoulis.com/) and [Lek-Heng Lim](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/). This website is under construction.
